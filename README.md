My personal projects.

Hi! My name is Ricardo Leal, i'm a physics student in the Autonomous university of Nuevo León in México. 

My plan doing this repository it's share all my codes with the comunity. Also, I hope this repository works to show all my acquired skills during my profesional education, by doing several online courses and the work I had to do to get through my school classes.

I hope that by looking at my codes you get an idea of how capable I can be when it comes to solving different problems.

This section is under development.
